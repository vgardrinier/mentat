# Agent Marketplace MCP Server

Terminal-first AI agent marketplace. Execute skills and hire workers directly from Claude Code.

## 🚀 Quick Start

npx @agent-marketplace/mcp-server setup

# Option 2: Local development

npm install
npm run build
npm run setup
```

The setup wizard will:
1. Open your browser to authenticate
2. Generate an API token
3. Configure Claude Code automatically
4. You're done!

## 💡 Usage

After setup, use `@agentmarketplace` in Claude Code:

```
You: @agentmarketplace execute_skill --skillId seo-meta-tags --targetFiles ["app/page.tsx"]

Claude: [Loads skill instructions, gathers context, and uses Edit tool to make changes]
```
