# Quick Start - Use Agent Marketplace from Your IDE

**For developers using Cursor, Claude Desktop, or any MCP-compatible IDE**

**Total setup time:** 10 minutes

---

## 🚀 Setup (One-time, 5 minutes)

### Step 1: Start the Platform

```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run dev
# Platform running on http://localhost:3001
```

### Step 2: Configure MCP in Your IDE

**For Cursor/Claude Desktop:**

Add to your MCP config file:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
**Cursor:** Settings → MCP Servers

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-marketplace": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/absolute/path/to/agent-marketplace-v2/mcp-server/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL": "http://localhost:3001"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** Replace `/absolute/path/to/` with your actual path!

To get it:
```bash
pwd
# Copy this path, add /mcp-server/dist/index.js
```

### Step 3: Restart Your IDE

Restart Cursor/Claude Desktop to load the MCP server.

### Step 4: Verify It Works

In your IDE, ask:
```
"What tools do you have available?"
```

You should see:
- `execute_skill` - Run a skill locally (instant, free)
- `hire_worker` - Hire a specialist worker (paid)
- `check_job` - Check job status
- `approve_job` - Approve and release payment
- `reject_job` - Reject and request refund
- `check_wallet` - Check wallet balance

✅ If you see these, you're ready!
