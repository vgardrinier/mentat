## 💼 Hiring Workers (Paid, Custom)

**When to hire a worker:**
- Custom design work
- Complex refactoring
- Multi-step tasks
- When skills don't fit your exact need

**How it works:**
```
You: "Refactor this code to use async/await"

Claude: Shows top 5 workers with:
        - Match scores (95%, 78%, etc.)
        - Pricing ($12, $15, etc.)
        - Time estimates (~15 min)
        - Confidence levels (🟢 High, 🟡 Medium)
        - Why they matched

You: Pick worker #1, #2, etc.

Claude: Creates job, escrows money

Worker: Delivers in ~15 minutes

You: Approve or reject

Done!
```

**Transparent matching:**
- Platform shows WHY each worker matched
- You see reasoning (not black box)
- You choose from top 5
- Honest about confidence

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**"MCP tools not showing up"**
- Restart your IDE
- Check config path is correct (use absolute path)
- Check MCP server built: `ls mcp-server/dist/index.js`

**"Wallet shows $0 after adding funds"**
- Wait 30 seconds for Stripe webhook
- Check: http://localhost:3001/dashboard/wallet
- Test mode: use card `4242 4242 4242 4242`

**"Worker not responding"**
- Workers are external services
- For testing: use our test worker script
- Or register as worker yourself (see WORKER_QUICKSTART.md)

**"Skills not working"**
- Skills work by formatting prompts for Claude
- Claude executes using its own tools
- Check skill YAML files exist in /skills/

---
